    .span12.columns
      %p Concerts in the Clearing are the work of Artistic Director Donald Krehbiel.
      %p Don has been a fixture on the Dallas musical scene for many years. He is the founder and Artistic Director of Orpheus Chamber Singers, the highly acclaimed Dallas-based vocal ensemble. He has been at First Unitarian Church of Dallas since 1989, and currently serves as Director of Music.
      %p With guidance, financial support, and production support from a team at First Unitarian Church, Concerts in the Clearing aims to bring high-quality music to Dallas, particularly including artists or performances that one might not see elsewhere in the city.
      %p A primary goal of the concert series is to engage audience members with each other and with performers. A catered reception follows each event, where concert-goers can relax with fellow music-lovers and perhaps make a new friend.
